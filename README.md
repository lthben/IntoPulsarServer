Code for an Espresso Lite ver 2 ESP8266 board. 

For a Night Festival 2016 installation at the National Museum of Singapore named 'Into Pulsar' by artist Ryf Zaini.
       
Three bicycles placed at the bottom of a 'tree'. User cycles any of these to trigger the 28 ebike wheels on top of the tree to go faster to show a pov image on the 4 led strips placed in a "+" pattern on the wheels.

This code is a WiFi server reading from three hall sensors and sends out the max analog value to the 28 Espresso clients for the 28 ebike wheels.
